## Development install

Best practices for development are to clone the source repo, create a virtual environment and install as an editable link with Pip. This will cause (most) changes made in the source code to be testable without resintalling. Here is an example command list:

```
git clone https://github.com/tgen/jetstream.git
virtualenv jetstream_venv
source jetstream_venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -e jetstream/
```
