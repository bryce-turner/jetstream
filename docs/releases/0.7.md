# Jetstream v0.7 Release Notes

# Major Notes

- `workflows.runner` has been replaced with a new module that implements the runner as a new class `AsyncRunner`. This class uses the [https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html](asyncio) library to handle the needs of concurrently updating the workflow, monitoring active tasks, and logging status updates. This removed a lot of confusing loop structures and replaced them with (hopefully less confusing) async events.

- A new `Task` class has been added to the workflows module. This centralizes all the procedures for checking/updating task properties. 

- Unittests are being used and have been written for much of the code. The nature of this project makes it difficult to write unittests for some features (Slurm backend, for example), but I'm trying.

- Some of the old cli commands have been streamlined. The `pipelines` command includes a `-r/--render-only` argument which essentially allows for a dry-run of the workflow rendering process. 

- I added some benchmarking scripts that I've been using to analyze performance under high task loads. In light of these tests, the workflow iteration was overhauled. The task management overhead should remain < 0.1s per task even with workflows containing 1 million tasks.
